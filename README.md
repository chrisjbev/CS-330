Project Reflection – Computational Graphics and Visualization
How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software by first identifying the problem and the requirements of the project. Before writing code, I think about how the different components of the program should interact and what the final outcome should look like. For this project, that meant planning the 3D scene layout, object placement, lighting, textures, and camera movement before implementation. This approach helps reduce errors later and ensures the design aligns with the project goals.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

This project helped me develop skills in spatial design and visual planning within a 3D environment. I learned how to balance realism with performance, choose appropriate textures and lighting, and organize scene elements logically. I also gained experience designing reusable components, such as materials and lighting configurations, that could be applied to multiple objects in the scene.

What design process did you follow for your project work?

I followed an iterative design process that started with a simple scene and gradually added complexity. First, I created basic shapes and layouts, then added textures, lighting, and camera controls. Each milestone built on the previous one, allowing me to refine the design and correct issues as they appeared. This process ensured steady progress while keeping the project manageable.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

The design tactics used in this project—planning ahead, breaking the project into smaller parts, and testing changes incrementally—can be applied to any future software project. These methods help manage complexity and make large projects easier to maintain and expand.

How do I approach developing programs?

I approach developing programs by focusing on clarity, organization, and testing. I write code in small sections, verify functionality frequently, and adjust based on results. For this project, development involved implementing one feature at a time, such as lighting or textures, and ensuring each worked correctly before moving on.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

I used modular programming strategies by separating scene management, rendering, and camera controls into different components. This made the code easier to understand and debug. I also learned to work with shaders, texture mapping, and transformations, which required a more structured and precise development approach than traditional console-based programs.

How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration was essential to the development process. I repeatedly adjusted object placement, lighting intensity, and camera angles to improve the scene’s appearance and functionality. Each iteration helped identify visual or logical issues and refine the final result.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?

Over the milestones, my approach became more organized and intentional. Early on, I focused mainly on making things work. As the project progressed, I paid more attention to code structure, readability, and efficiency. I also became more comfortable debugging graphical issues and understanding how changes in one part of the program affected the overall scene.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science helps me reach my goals by giving me problem-solving skills and technical knowledge that can be applied across many industries. It allows me to create software solutions, analyze data, and build interactive systems. This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement complex systems, which is valuable for both education and career development.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

This project strengthened my understanding of linear algebra, transformations, and rendering techniques. These concepts are foundational in many advanced computer science courses, including game development, simulations, and data visualization. The hands-on experience with graphics programming provides a strong base for future coursework.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Computational graphics and visualizations provide skills that are directly applicable to industries such as game development, simulation, UI/UX design, and scientific visualization. I learned how to build and manage a 3D environment, use textures and lighting effectively, and structure a graphics application. These skills demonstrate my ability to work with complex visual systems and produce polished, interactive software.
